        Note because I know it's a bit confusing:<br>
        "X More Days Remaining" means "this day and X more" left in the dealership.<br>
        ie. "2 More Days Remaining" -> "1 More Day Remaining" -> "Last Day Remaining".<br>
        Hope that clears up any confusion.<br>

        Recent changes:</strong><br>
        - GT ENGINE now has a BoP listing for Gr.3! It's linked to in the Balance of Performance section. (22-03-30)<br>
        - Got rid of the "custom race" info in Legend Cars, it was mostly there as a joke and got in the way of the NEW label for the '70 Skyline (bc of it's really long name). (22-03-27)<br>
        - I've been made aware that a couple legendary cars were available for less time than estimated, so I've reduced the estimate. (22-03-23)<br>
        - Shuffled the sections around a bit to make the Daily Races closer to the top. (22-03-22)<br>
        - Daily Races have been added - note the styling is incomplete. (22-03-22)<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Breaking data.json changes:</strong><br>
        - Booleans have all been changed to actual booleans instead of y/n strings. (22-03-24)<br>

      You may see some cars before the ones displayed here.<br>
      These come from the menu book you currently have active.<br>
      A list of these menu book specific used cars can be found <a href="#menu-book-used-section">here</a>. (coming soon)<br>
      <br>
      Estimates assume cars will be available for 7 days after they appear.<br>
      For used cars it seems to actually be 7 to 9 days (so cars may appear for longer) - note that cars ARE always "Limited Stock" for 2 days, however.<br>

      To better explain the problems with GT7's economy, estimated 'grind' and 'normal' playtimes have been added.<br>
      For 'grind', this assumes that you are extremely efficient and earn 900k Cr. per hour by doing nothing but the single current best event.<br>
      For 'normal', this assumes you're playing reasonably and earning 200k Cr. per hour <i>but not spending a single credit until you can afford the car</i>.<br>

      <strong>GT ENGINE now has GT7's BoP for Group 3 cars!</strong><br>
      <a href="https://gt-engine.com/gt7/cars/gr3/gr3-01-specs.html">Gran Turismo 7 BoP: Gr.3</a><br>
      It's also presented in actual table form with sorting, instead of the images they used for GT Sport. :)<br>
      <br>
      For other classes, you can check GT Sport's BoP here:<br>
      <a href="https://gt-engine.com/gtsport/cars/gr1/gr1_specs.html#spec_tables">Gran Turismo Sport BoP: Gr.1</a><br>
      <a href="https://gt-engine.com/gtsport/cars/gr2/gr2_specs.html#spec_tables">Gran Turismo Sport BoP: Gr.2</a><br>
      <a href="https://gt-engine.com/gtsport/cars/gr4/gr4_specs.html#spec_tables">Gran Turismo Sport BoP: Gr.4</a><br>
      <a href="https://gt-engine.com/gtsport/cars/grb/grb_specs.html#spec_tables">Gran Turismo Sport BoP: Gr.B</a><br>
      This data is presented on the site in image form.<br>
      GT7 uses different BoP to GT Sport. However, it may be roughly similar (for cars that were in GT Sport).
