        Note because I know it's a bit confusing:<br>
        "X More Days Remaining" means "this day and X more" left in the dealership.<br>
        ie. "2 More Days Remaining" -> "1 More Day Remaining" -> "Last Day Remaining".<br>
        Hope that clears up any confusion.<br>

        Recent changes:</strong><br>
        - v1.11 is out! More UCD, LCD cars, less grinding, endurance events... (22-04-07)<br>
        - If a car is given as a reward, this is now noted in the dealerships. Hover over the icon to see where to get that car for free. (22-04-04)<br>
        - GT ENGINE now has a BoP listing for Gr.3! It's linked to in the Balance of Performance section. (22-03-30) (and now Gr.4! 22-03-31) (and now Gr.B / Gr.2! 22-04-05)<br>
        - Got rid of the "custom race" info in Legend Cars, it was mostly there as a joke and got in the way of the NEW label for the '70 Skyline (bc of it's really long name). (22-03-27)<br>
        - I've been made aware that a couple legendary cars were available for less time than estimated, so I've reduced the estimate. (22-03-23)<br>
        - Shuffled the sections around a bit to make the Daily Races closer to the top. (22-03-22)<br>
        - Daily Races have been added - <s>note the styling is incomplete.</s> (22-03-22) Eh, the styling isn't that bad. It's honestly just way too much effort to get it "correct". (22-04-05)<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Breaking data.json changes:</strong><br>
        - Booleans have all been changed to actual booleans instead of y/n strings. (22-03-24)<br>
        - For a short time, daily race specific cars were given as db IDs: that's been reverted back to names. (22-04-04)<br>

      Playtime calculations have been updated to a rough estimate for v1.11 rewards.<br>
      For 'one-time rewards', this is a very rough example of how fast you can earn with Circuit Experience.<br>
      For 'grind', this assumes that you earn 1.81m Cr. per hour by doing nothing but the single current best event. <small>You can go a bit faster, I know. This is just an estimate.</small><br>
      For 'normal', this assumes you're playing reasonably and earning 400k Cr. per hour.<br>
