        Got rid of a bunch of stuff from this top section.<br>
        If you play GT7 enough to check the dealerships here, you're aware of the hellish state of the game.<br>
        There's no point in me reiterating it further.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Recent changes:</strong><br>
        - Legend Cars now shows "how long to grind", plus some other fun stats to show how ruined the game's economy is.<br>

      You may see some cars before the ones displayed here.<br>
      These come from the menu book you currently have active.<br>
      A list of these menu book specific used cars can be found <a href="#menu-book-used-section">here</a>. (coming soon)<br>
      <br>
      The displayed estimates assume cars will be available for 7 days after they appear.<br>
      This is not always true (hence, estimate) - note that cars ARE always "Limited Stock" for 2 days, however.<br>
      "Estimate: Limited Stock Soon" is displayed for cars that are lasting longer than estimated.<br>

      To better explain the problems with GT7's economy, estimated 'grind' and 'normal' playtimes have been added.<br>
      For 'grind', this assumes that you are extremely efficient and earn 900k Cr. per hour by doing nothing but the single current best event.<br>
      For 'normal', this assumes you're playing reasonably and earning 200k Cr. per hour <i>but not spending a single credit until you can afford the car</i>.<br>
      <br>
      Oh, there's also some fun data with custom race payouts. These are with the player at the back of a 20 car grid on Professional difficulty.<br>
      Number of 24 hour custom races is self-explanatory. A 24 hour duration custom race pays out 122,053 Cr.<br>
      Number of Gr.3 custom race laps of the Nordschleife is calculated based on 10 lap races (which give the most efficient reward). This is 62,038 Cr. per race.<br>

      Also, GT7 uses different BoP. However, it should be roughly similar (for cars that were in GT Sport).
